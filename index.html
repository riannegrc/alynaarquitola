		<h3> THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO MAKEUP BRUSHES </h3>
		<p>Makeup brushes don't come with instruction manuals, but they really should. Figuring out exactly where each tool is<br>meant to be used
		on your face along with which makeup products is just as overwhelming as following the instructions<br>for building an Ikea dresser. That's why
		we turned to New York City makeup artists Lindsey Williams and Daniel Martin<br>to breakdown exactly what each makeup brush does, and what produts
		work best with them. Whether you're new to makeup<br>brushes entirely, or you're looking to build a staple collection, consider this your
		comprehensive guide to know which<br>ones you need to invest in.</p>
